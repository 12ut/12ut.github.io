What is the prase for "novel coronavirus" in Globien? 

To build a Globien word, we use the "English/French Word + Chinese Pinyin" form. Let's have a look:

* new/novel：new + xin = nine  （-e indicates an adjective word）
* crown/corona：corona + guan = koronuan (c changed to k according to the pronunciation)
* virus：virus + du = viru

Connecting them, the phrase in Globien is:

**nine koronuan viru**

Quite simple, right? Though it has been changed in some way, it's still very easy to understand for a Indo-European language speaker, especially for English speaker.

The changed part, word rhyme, is helpful for Chinese speaker.  It's still a little bit hard for Chinese though.  To help more, Globien has another style for Chinese biginners:  

**nin<sup>x</sup>e koronuan<sup>g</sup> viru<sup>d</sup>**

The superscript is not a portion of a word.  It's just a hint.  An Indo-European speaker call always ignore them safely.
